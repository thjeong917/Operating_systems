## **Project 1**
**Goal**
* Implement a simple user-level command line interpreter using C. (also called shell)
* Shell can be run in two ways : Interactive mode & Batch mode
* In interactive mode, shell displays a prompt and user types in a command at the prompt.
* In batch mode, shell is started by specifying a batch file on its command line. The batch file contains the list of commands that should be executed.


## **Project 2 (xv6)**

* Key of this design is to schedule the switching between MLFQ scheduler and stride scheduler efficiently without violating the time limit.
